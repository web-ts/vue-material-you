# About the VueMaterialYou framework

VueMaterialYou it's supposed to be a complete recreation of Google's new `Material You` or `Material Design 3` design language with support for the official components presented at [https://m3.material.io/components](https://m3.material.io/components). Right now it only offers a small subset of those components but the planned `1.0.0` release will offer at least support for the official components.

## Motivation

I started this not as a passion project, but more because of a need in one of my other projects. I could not find something that would follow the new design language from Google or at least something that is properly `EXPOSING` the APIs for the form components that it would offer and I think the lather was the deciding factor behind this.

I always find myself in need to create custom form components and inputs and every library/framework that I could find does only offer partial support or none at all. As such this framework will expose it's internal form validators and handlers so anyone can extend and create whatever form input their heart desires.
