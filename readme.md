# Vue Material You

> Material design 3 UI framework for Vue 3

Material You is the new design language created for the newer version of android. This library helps bring the same look and feel to the web. 

This project is currently in the early stages so I would not recommend using it in production. Feel free to report any issues that you might find. 

The library consists of a small amount of components for now, but I will add more with time.
